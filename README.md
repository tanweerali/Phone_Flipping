# Phone_Flipping
The Phone Flipping Project

**What?**

I built a SaaS(Analytics as a service) for iPhone resellers in the US. 
Helping them appraise and estimate iPhone prices with weekly pricing reports sent directly to their email.

**Why?**

Phone resellers were appraising/estimating iPhone prices manually by going on eBay.com everyday.
I automated that process and gave them access to weekly pricing reports with data freshly scraped from eBay.

**How?**

I built multiple bots using Scrapy in Python.
Prices were scraped every single day from eBay, and a weekly analysis of all the data pulled during the week was done every Friday morning before sending out the Weekly report.
