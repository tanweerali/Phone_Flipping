The Phone Flipping Project

**What?**

I built a SaaS(Analytics as a service) for iPhone resellers in the US.
Helping them appraise and estimate iPhone prices with weekly pricing reports sent directly to their email.

**Why?**

Phone resellers were appraising/estimating iPhone prices manually by going on eBay(.)com. I automated that process and gave them access to weekly pricing reports with data freshly scraped from eBay.
Helping them stay up-to-date with current iPhone resale prices.

**How?**

I built multiple bots using Scrapy in Python.
Prices were scraped every single day from eBay, and a weekly analysis of all the data pulled during the week was done every Friday morning before sending the Weekly report.
The report was generated from a single Jupyter Notebook which I converted into a PDF. All data processes were automated on a local Debian Linux server.

**Note:**

This project was really scrappy, I released the MVP as fast as possible to confirm the product market fit of my idea and solution. It was a success because I ended up monetizing it in the first month with a Pro plan.

I unfortunately had to put an end to it in 2020.
